Hi! This folder (or whatever containment unit you are reading this from) contains R scripts that I use to download and prepare data for ecological niche modeling, as well as generate and evaluate models in ENMEval. Much of the code requires common packages for niche modeling and ecological analyses, such as dismo and ecospat, and essentiall acts as a wrap-around or master script for many of the commands/tools I use most. I have also added in scripts to visualize and compare distributions of suitabiltiy scores, compute evaluation metrics that are not included in the ENMEval package, and add input-type flexibility for a variety of analyses that are generally performed excusively inside one R package with somewhat strict data format requirements. I will continue to update and add to these scripts.
