# This function is used to query databases for occurrence data and then clean the data
# to get rid of unlikely or poor quality occurrences.

#
# method == How do you want to get and clean data? Only using spocc package now.
# usr.query == a species name or list of species name to make query with.
# usr.db == Which databases fo you want to query? See spocc package for more details.
# usr.ref == a raster file used to ensure all occurrence data are in a cell that contains environmental data.
# usr.output == a csv with occurrence data that passed this QC.
